Spent some time to resolve some UI functionality that I don't particularly like. Updated the navigation menu to be a little cleaner. Removed the back button and added tooltips. Tomorrow will focus on improving blog index homepage.

Spent some time investigating react-spring and framer motion to get a better understanding of UI animation. Honestly, it is pretty complex, but super exciting. Hoping to continue to learn more about it. Tomorrow will focus on completing the basic pong game and starting an implementation of a dynamic tree animation.

On the blog side, adding a search bar to the blog list to experiment with search functionality.
