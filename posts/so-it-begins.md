I am starting this blog to expand my knowledge of front end development and to work through some of my other anxiety related issues. Currently I am a Software Engineer working at Qualtrics, but I have taken a 3 month leave of absence with the goals of: solving my work related anxiety and finding my calling in life. So should be able to finish all of that in a week or so.

This website will evolve beyond a blog as I try to create and learn new projects. Maybe one day I will start a start-up, then this will all be documented as the beginning. If not, then this was good practice before I move on in my career.

To start the blog off, we are developing this wedsite with a mixture of NextJS and Github pages (to keep it cheap READ:free). For now it is a simple loading page with little customization. 

Notes on the NextJS documentation:
- Awesome. Super helpful and easy to follow.
- Initially, this framework appears to streamline a lot of stuff. I am a little worried that it may become ridged in the future. Will document as I work.
- Filename routing is a trip.
