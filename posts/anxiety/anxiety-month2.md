Long time between posts. I had a few things come up that somewhat derailed my progress. These are not excuses but outline why blogging wasn't the top priority. A family member unfortunately passed away and I took a few days to reflect. Then I had a bachelor party to attend for a weekend (was fun, no negative experiences here).

Last Thursday I had an appointment with a psychotherapist to address my anxiety and help me work towards a more healthy lifestyle. Overall, I think the appointment went well and I scheduled an appointment for later this month.

Some topics that were discussed:
* My childhood and how it could impact my current anxiety.
* My work process and how it could impact my current anxiety.
* My diet and how it could impact my anxiety (Happened to be drinking an energy drink during the session, whoops.).
* A few tool that I could practice daily to help calm my mind.
* There is a chance that I may be viewing all emotions as anxiety. Maybe I need to view what an emotion is more.

Tools:
* Breathing exercise where an individual breathes in via the abdomen while on their back. The key here is to have the exhale be twice the length as the inhale. 3 - 5 minutes a day.
* Repeat "I am safe, I am connected, and I am secure" when I begin to have anxiety related feelings.
* Pinch the location between the thumb and the pointer finger. This can help reduce some of the most extreme anxiety symptoms. Random fact, also takes away the gag reflex...

For the next few days, I'll be focused on working on the above tools and not drinking energy drinks (RIP).
