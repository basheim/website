I have been taking this week easy, taking many breaks and focusing on myself. I haven't been feeling down or anxious about work since my leave has begun. Honestly, I haven't felt this good for awhile. I am beginning to get a little restless, so having some side projects has helped keep me sane. Overall, I hope to have the energy to spend more time working on my skills and less on relaxing in the near future. For now, I am happy that I took this break. 

Goals:
- Begin healthy habits: brush teeth twice daily, walk the dog daily, run / workout daily, shave daily, drink more water, clean at least 1 room a day, and create a consistent sleep schedule.
- Schedule appointment with counselor.
- Begin working half day schedules with CS related projects / tasks.
- Read daily.


Completed Tasks:
- Healthy Habits started: brush teeth twice daily, walk the dog daily, run daily, and clean at least 1 room a day. The remainder are still in progress.
- Counselor appointment is scheduled for May.
- Website is up and running (though very basic currently).
- Reading is sporatic at best.
