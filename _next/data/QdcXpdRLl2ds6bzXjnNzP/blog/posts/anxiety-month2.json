{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"anxiety-month2","contentHtml":"<p>Long time between posts. I had a few things come up that somewhat derailed my progress. These are not excuses but outline why blogging wasn't the top priority. A family member unfortunately passed away and I took a few days to reflect. Then I had a bachelor party to attend for a weekend (was fun, no negative experiences here).</p>\n<p>Last Thursday I had an appointment with a psychotherapist to address my anxiety and help me work towards a more healthy lifestyle. Overall, I think the appointment went well and I scheduled an appointment for later this month.</p>\n<p>Some topics that were discussed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My childhood and how it could impact my current anxiety.</li>\n<li>My work process and how it could impact my current anxiety.</li>\n<li>My diet and how it could impact my anxiety (Happened to be drinking an energy drink during the session, whoops.).</li>\n<li>A few tool that I could practice daily to help calm my mind.</li>\n<li>There is a chance that I may be viewing all emotions as anxiety. Maybe I need to view what an emotion is more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breathing exercise where an individual breathes in via the abdomen while on their back. The key here is to have the exhale be twice the length as the inhale. 3 - 5 minutes a day.</li>\n<li>Repeat \"I am safe, I am connected, and I am secure\" when I begin to have anxiety related feelings.</li>\n<li>Pinch the location between the thumb and the pointer finger. This can help reduce some of the most extreme anxiety symptoms. Random fact, also takes away the gag reflex...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the next few days, I'll be focused on working on the above tools and not drinking energy drinks (RIP).</p>\n","title":"Anxiety Month 2","date":"2021-05-10","description":"Notes on my 2nd month anxiety leave","tags":"Anxiety"}},"__N_SSG":true}
