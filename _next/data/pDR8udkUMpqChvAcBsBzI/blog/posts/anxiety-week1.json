{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"anxiety-week1","contentHtml":"<p>I have been taking this week easy, taking many breaks and focusing on myself. I haven't been feeling down or anxious about work since my leave has begun. Honestly, I haven't felt this good for awhile. I am beginning to get a little restless, so having some side projects has helped keep me sane. Overall, I hope to have the energy to spend more time working on my skills and less on relaxing in the near future. For now, I am happy that I took this break.</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Begin healthy habits: brush teeth twice daily, walk the dog daily, run / workout daily, shave daily, drink more water, clean at least 1 room a day, and create a consistent sleep schedule.</li>\n<li>Schedule appointment with counselor.</li>\n<li>Begin working half day schedules with CS related projects / tasks.</li>\n<li>Read daily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Completed Tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Healthy Habits started: brush teeth twice daily, walk the dog daily, run daily, and clean at least 1 room a day.
