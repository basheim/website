I am a Software Engineer currently working at Qualtrics with a little unusual of a background.

Background:
- Graduated from University of Washington with an Electrical Engineering degree, focusing on embedded computing systems.
- During college, I interned at Boeing and complete research into high voltage applications.
- Started my career at Micron as a Product Engineer.
- Decided to move away from hardware and began my career at Qualtrics as a Software Test Engineer.
- Moved into a Software Engineer role around 1.5 years ago.
